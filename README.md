## *About Wise Owl Toys and Company* 
<p> We have over 2,000 full-time and part-time employees, and we sell a variety of toys and games for educational and play purposes. </p>

## *Current Management System*
<p>Our current system consists of mostly manual processing using an MS Excel spreadsheet to control payroll processing.<p>
<p>The system consists of the three payroll staff members reviewing each of the full-time staff members' wages, calculating how many hours they worked based on their hourly rate, and paying them by issuing a check.</p>
<p>The check needs to be entered in another worksheet for each of the people who were paid so that we can tell when it went out, how much it was for, and if it was cashed or not. If a [Date_Cashed] is entered, we deduct that amount from our working payroll capital account to track how much money we have for payroll.</p>
<p>This process is then repeated for all part-time staff and independent contractors.</p>
